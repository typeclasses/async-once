  * The action shall run at most once

{- | Like 'lazyAsync', but does not automatically stop the action

The returned 'Resource' includes the desired 'LazyAsync' (the 'resource'), as
well as a 'release' action that brings it to a halt. If the action is not yet
started, 'release' prevents it from ever starting. If the action is in progress,
'release' throws an async exception to stop it. If the action is completed,
'release' has no effect.

A 'LazyAsync.LazyAsync' represents a background thread which may be utilizing
time and space. A running thread is not automatically reaped by the garbage
collector, so one should take care to eventually 'release' every 'LazyAsync'
resource to avoid accidentally leaving unwanted 'LazyAsync's running.
